## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `HARDWARE_V2.md` — sensor upgrade plan with confirmed BOM: AHT20+BMP280 combo, Adafruit STEMMA soil sensor, INA219 power monitor; all I2C, STEMMA QT connectors; Rust crate analysis, wiring diagram, firmware checklist
- Mermaid wiring diagrams for V1 (current) and V2 (planned) hardware added to `README.md`
- `Actuator` enum in `domain.rs` — mirrors the `Sensor` enum pattern; currently holds `Pump(bool)`; adding a new actuator (e.g. humidifier) is just a new variant + bump of `Vec` capacity
- `src/sensors/` module replacing `sensors_task.rs`: `hardware.rs` (peripheral init), `adc.rs` (generic ADC sampling, unified `read_powered_adc_sensor` eliminates moisture/water-level duplication), `builder.rs` (data assembly), `mod.rs` (thin Embassy task entry)
- Sensor sampling constants (`PUMP_TRIGGER_INTERVAL`, `USB_CHARGING_VOLTAGE_MV`, `DHT11_WARMUP_DELAY_MS`, `SENSOR_WARMUP_DELAY_MS`, `SENSOR_SAMPLE_COUNT`) moved to `config.rs`

### Changed
- Power: CPU clock reduced from 240 MHz to 80 MHz — sufficient for I/O-bound workload, cuts CPU dynamic power ~3×
- Power: display is initialised in sleep state on timer wakes (nobody present); only button wakes (Ext0) turn on the backlight and draw sensor data — saves ~20–30 mA for the entire awake window on unattended cycles
- Power: DHT11 is now read once per wake cycle (one 2 s warmup) instead of once per sample (5 × 2 s = 10 s warmup). The single reading is replicated across all sample slots so the averaging logic is unchanged. Saves ~8 s of active time per wake.
- `update_task.rs`: fixed MQTT event loop starvation — the inner select now uses `select3` to race sensor data, MQTT poll, and `STOP_UPDATE_TASK_SIGNAL` simultaneously; when the stop signal fires the display `enable_powersave()` is called immediately before the task exits, preserving power-save behaviour without blocking MQTT for 30 s
- `update_task.rs` / `main.rs`: introduced `DISPLAY_POWERSAVE_SIGNAL` (separate from `STOP_WIFI_SIGNAL`) — Embassy `Signal` stores only one waker, so sharing a single signal between two tasks meant only one task was reliably notified; each task now has its own signal fired together from `main`
- `enter_deep` in `sleep.rs`: removed log statement that fired immediately before `rtc.sleep()` (USB CDC has no chance to flush it); caller in `main.rs` now logs + awaits 100 ms before entering sleep so all pending output is transmitted

### Documentation
- `README.md`: added explicit note that MQTT publishing is intentionally suppressed when battery voltage exceeds `USB_CHARGING_VOLTAGE_MV` (board powered via USB); this is a design decision, not a bug
- MQTT discovery payload now includes `force_update: true` for numeric sensors — prevents Home Assistant recorder from deduplicating unchanged values, giving full hourly history resolution
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` — added changelog and code quality workflow requirements
- `PumpTrigger(bool)` removed from the `Sensor` enum — it was incorrectly appearing as a Home Assistant sensor entity; pump state now lives in `SensorData.actuators: Vec<Actuator, 1>`
- `update_task.rs` reads pump state from `sensor_data.actuators` instead of iterating `sensor_data.data` for `Sensor::PumpTrigger`
